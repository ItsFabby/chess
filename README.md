# Chess AI with Neural Network

## About the Project
Deepmind's AlphaZero revolutionized the world of chess in 2018 by creating a neural network that learned chess all by itself and being able to beat the top engines at the time. To train and run the network, the team had access to Google's supercomputer infrastructure. 

This project trains a neural network on a standard home computer, by scaling down the structure of the network and using supervised learning with examples generated from Stockfish.
